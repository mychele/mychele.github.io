# Hello!
* I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova. My supervisor is <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=Z7d93ZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank">Prof. Michele Zorzi</a>. My research involves 5G networks, and a particular attention is given to end to end performance, reliability and consistency of performance of mmWave cellular. Check the <a href="/publications">publications section to know more about these topics.

* I am interested in social and political issues, in particular the ones related to technology and the disruption brought by it. 

* I play the acoustic and the electric guitar, the banjo and the ukulele. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ej1ZjzlDs" target="_blank">this video</a> from my band.

# Hello!
* I am an Assistant Research Professor at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, Northeastern University, Boston (<a href="/assets/pdf/polese-cv-2023-10-01" target="_blank">CV</a>). My research interests are on 
	- open, programmable, intelligent next-generation cellular networks
	- spectrum sharing and active/passive user coexistence
	- mmWave and terahertz mobile networks
	- open-source networking software
	- performance evaluation of end-to-end complex networks with experimental testbeds and system-level simulations.

* Previously, I was Principal Research Scientist at Northeastern. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2020 at the University of Padova, Italy, with <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=Z7d93ZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank">Prof. Michele Zorzi</a>. During my Ph.D., I visited New York University (NYU), in April 2017, AT&T Labs in Bedminster, NJ, in May and June 2018, and Northeastern University in March-July 2019.

* Our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024837" target="_blank">O-RAN tutorial (open access)</a> is one of most cited resources on this topic. You can find more resources on the <a href="openrangym.com" target="_blank">OpenRAN Gym website</a>.

* We discuss 6G networks and the technological path toward 6G in the IEEE Communications Magazine paper "Towards 6G Networks: Use Cases and Technologies", also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12216" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.

* I am interested in social and political issues, in particular the ones related to technology and the disruption brought by it. 

* I play the acoustic and the electric guitar, the banjo and the ukulele. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ej1ZjzlDs" target="_blank">this video</a> from one of my band.

* I read a lot of books.

* Currently trying to understanding the magic behind film photography.

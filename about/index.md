# Hello!
* I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova. My supervisor is <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=Z7d93ZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank">Prof. Michele Zorzi</a>. My research involves 5G networks, and a particular attention is given to end to end performance, mobility, reliability and consistency of performance of mmWave cellular. 

* I am currently visiting Northestern University as a Visiting Scholar, working on mmWaves in the <a href="http://www.ece.neu.edu/wineslab/" target="_blank">WiNES Lab</a>.

* I visited New York University (NYU), in April 2017, and AT&T Labs in Bedminster, NJ, in May and June 2018.

* Check the <a href="/publications">publications section</a> to know more about these topics and the <a href="http://mmwave.dei.unipd.it" target="_blank">mmWave website @ DEI, UNIPD</a>.

* I recently presented some research results on a webinar for the IEEE Future Networks Initiative, you can find it <a href="https://ieee.webex.com/ec3300/eventcenter/recording/recordAction.do?siteurl=ieee&theAction=poprecord&recordID=56167302&internalRecordTicket=4832534b0000000420358179fdab7b09614f207a8e82ac16189a534f9ad0e81177718c062b2ac4e0" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Hello!
* I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova. My supervisor is <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=Z7d93ZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank">Prof. Michele Zorzi</a>. My research involves 5G networks, and a particular attention is given to end to end performance, reliability and consistency of performance of mmWave cellular. In april 2017 I visited NYU Wireless as a Visiting Academin. Check the <a href="/publications">publications section to know more about these topics and the <a href="http://mmwave.dei.unipd.it" target="_blank"mmWave website @ DEI, UNIPD</a>.

The ns-3 mmWave module is available on <a href="https://github.com/nyuwireless/ns3-mmwave">Github</a>. The development effort is lead by <a href="http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu">NYU Wireless</a>, and I developed the DC framework described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04748">this</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05425">this</a> paper, available in the new-handover branch of the NYU repo. Check out also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04822">the implementation</a> of the 3GPP channel model for the 6-100 GHz band.

Wireless Systems and Networks class final project, by Michele Polese and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-olivotto-a1731061" target="_blank">Stefano Olivotto</a>.
Network coding techniques can be used to efficiently transmit data over wireless links and networks. In this project we will describe an implementation of a sender/receiver pair that by using network coding and ARQ mechanisms transmits a file over different kind of connections. We will show that the choice of different parameters outlines trade-offs in terms of different performance metrics, and that the system reaches high efficiency and goodput when used over a real connection from Padova to Lausanne.

The code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mychele/wsn1516-finalproject">Github</a>, and the report is <a href="/assets/pdf/wsn_olivotto_polese.pdf">here</a>.

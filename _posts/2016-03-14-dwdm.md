Channel Coding class final project, for which I implemented and evaluated the performance of the ITU-T G.975.1 binary LDPC code. This code is used with DWDM submarine systems in order to perform Forward Error Correction. See the <a href="/assets/pdf/channel.pdf">presentation</a> for more details and the results of the performance evaluation.

The implementation relies on the flexibility and modularity given by object oriented programming paradigm. The encoder/decoder pair is written in C++. The code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mychele/channelcoding1516/tree/master/final_project_DWDM" target="_blank">Github</a>.

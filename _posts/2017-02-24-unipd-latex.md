I created a fork of Dissertate, a modern LaTeX template for a thesis or disseration, adapting it to the UNIPD style. This is not an official template, check if your Department has specific requirements for the Thesis template. [Here's a sample](http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/52719/1/tesi_michele_polese.pdf).

Download it here (also with instructions on how to use it):
- [UNIPD (LaTeX)](http://polese.io/assets/Dissertate-UNIPD-LaTeX.zip)

There is also a [Github repo](https://github.com/mychele/unipd-latex-template)

Telecommunication Networks class final project, by Michele Polese, <a href="http://magr.in" target="_blank">Davide Magrin</a> and <a href="http://ipol.gq">Paolo Scaramuzza</a>.
In this project we introduced the Homework Inherent Protocol Such That Efficiency Rises (HIPSTER), a file transfer protocol designed to work on top of the UDP transport layer. The aim of the protocol is to minimize transfer time over an unreliable transport channel, which introduces delay and drops packets. HIPSTER is able to reach low transfer times despite the unreliable channel: read the results of the performance evaluation in <a href="/assets/pdf/hipster.pdf">this report</a>.

The code is on <a href="https://github.com/DvdMgr/HIPSTER/tree/final">Github</a>.
